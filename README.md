## Introduction
The Stylist Assistant is a companion for stylists and their clients. In the industry today, personal stylists work with their clients closely, often on a daily basis, helping them achieve the client's desired personal style goal. This makes being a personal stylist a full-time job, and hiring a personal stylist very expensive. Hence, very few people have a personal stylist. 

By reducing the stylist's time commitment we can reduce the time and cost barriers for clients, thus increasing the demand in the industry.

### Collaborators
Capstone projects at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Engineering are usually in groups of 3–5. I worked on this project with [Rui Wu](https://github.com/rwu780) and [Vitor Mendonca](https://github.com/vitor-vfm).

View everyone's contributions in the original repository [here](https://github.com/ECE493Group3/stylist-assistant).

### Objective
The Stylist Assistant seeks to help stylists with their clients daily style using image detection to recognize clothing items, data science to match outfits and a mobile app to interface between the two parties.

The project's potential to disrupt and grow the industry to a large degree makes it a potentially revolutionary technology.

## Final Report 
The final report I wrote for the course with diagrams and mockups that the course required. 

Honestly it's probably better to skim through [my blog post](https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/stylist-assistant-updating-stylists-to-do-more-236bf74c50a7). The style of the Final Report was required to be a specific way that's not that informative.
